# project #3 : Maze Generator (not finished yet)
"Union-Find , the data structure that left a deep impression on me." <br />
Generating random maze using Disjoint-Set (Union-Find) and randomly uniting nodes. <br />
A Disjoint set is represented by 2 nested lists , and each node is represented by (i,j) where i,j are the indecies of row,column (respectively) of the node in the nested list <br />
the project was created after finishing Data-Structures course at Tel-Aviv University, due to the impression Union-Find left on me. <br />

Note : Working on expanding classes methods, adding a simple representation of the maze, adding GUI.
