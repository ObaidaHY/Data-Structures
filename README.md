# project #1 : AVLTreeList 
Implementing the ADT List with balanced Binary Trees , specifically AVL binary Trees.
we're interested in making some functions operate with time complexity of O(logn) WC , 
and as anticipated the time complexity of other functions would be affected (kind of a trade-off)
