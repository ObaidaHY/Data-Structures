# Advanced Data-Structures

# project #1 : AVLTreeList 
Implementing the ADT List with balanced Binary Trees , specifically AVL binary Trees.
we're interested in making some functions operate with run time complexity of O(logn) WC , 
and as anticipated the run time complexity of other functions would be affected (kind of a trade-off)

Note : project 1 is implemented in python


# project #2 COMING SOON!!
