# Advanced Data-Structures

# project #1 : AVLTreeList 
Implementing the ADT List with balanced Binary Trees , specifically AVL binary Trees.<br />
we're interested in making some functions operate with run time complexity of O(logn) WC , <br />
and as anticipated the run time complexity of other functions would be affected (kind of a trade-off)

Note : project 1 is implemented with Python.


# project #2 : HashTables
Implementing Hash Tables with Open Addressing (for dealing with collisions) using 4 different probing methods : <br />
Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Alternate Quadratic Probing, Double Hash Probing.<br />
we're interested in comparing the performance of these different probing methods in terms of time efficiency,<br />
and we got to really interesting results.

Note : project 2 is implemented with Java.


# project #3 : Maze Generator
"Union-Find , the data structure that left a deep impression on me." <br />
Generating random maze using Disjoint-Set (Union-Find) and randomly uniting nodes. <br />
A Disjoint set is represented by 2 nested lists , and each node is represented by (i,j) where i,j are the indecies of row,column (respectively) of the node in the nested list <br />
the project was created after finishing Data-Structures course at Tel-Aviv University, due to the impression Union-Find left on me. <br />
